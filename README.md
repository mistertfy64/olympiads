mistertfy64's file for computer olympiad camps

## About

This is what mistertfy64 did on his two school break periods in the 2023 Academic Year. I spent approximately 4 weeks in the POSN Training Camps for Informatics (ค่าย สอวน.), split into 2 weeks in the first training camp at Debsirin School (October 2023) and 2 more weeks in the second training camp at Dept. of Computer Science at King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang (KMITL) (March 2024 to April 2024). Certificate of completions were also given. 

Per mistertfy64's interpretation, Camp 1 is more about the fundamentals of programming using C, while Camp 2 is about data structures and algorithms (i.e., second-year university stuff according to a professor) using C++.

At the end (or sometimes middle) of each camp, a test is given. Attendees who perform well can go to the next camp (or be in the team for Thailand Olympiad in Informatics for Camp 2's tests). Those who didn't advance may retake the camp exams in the next academic year, provided they are still in the allowed grade range.

As already stated above, mistertfy64 had the opportunity to attend Camp 1 and Camp 2 in the 2023 Academic Year. Unfortunately, he did not make the team for the 20th Thailand Olympiad in Informatics. He also can't retake the Camp 2 exams in the next academic year as he is already out of the allowed grade range.

There are also POSN training camps for Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Math, Astronomy, Geography, and Earth Science, with the same/similar purposes (to find representatives for Thailand to compete in the International Olympiad in \[insert subject name here\]), although the Astronomy, Geography, and Earth Science camps aren't as popular as the Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Math and Informatics (Computer) counterparts.

This is the code written by mistertfy64 while in the training camps.

## Changelog/Journal

2024-05-24: Updated `README.md` with a LOT of information. Additionally, I would also like to disclose that I actually also have a seperate private repository for competitive programming practice (before POSN Camp 1) with a lot of more solutions to external (non-camp) problems (e.g., on contest sites) that I've used for additional practice. I don't plan on making my private practice repository public yet (this may change in the future) because I don't want other people to see my cringy commit messages. 

2024-04-18: I did not get selected to compete in the 20th Thailand Olympiad in Informatics, so don't expect any more commits to this repository. This repository won't be going anywhere however. Thank you to everyone who gave me this opportunity!

2024-04-03: POSN Camp 2 has ended. The only thing to do now is wait for the representative annonucements.

2024-02-06: I wanna be ผู้แทนศูนย์ and get a TOI medal but my skill is :poop:
